## HOW IT WORKS:
Our main goal was to develop an extension for extracting the image in single step.For that ,we initialy wrote code to read a pdf file and count the number of images on each page.The requested image was exracted after creating a list of all the images on that specific page in the stage.

## WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR ACCOMPLISHED:


 - Our main.py program works to retrieve the required page's picture list.

 - The creation of extension and their saving interface is still a way off.

 - We are excited to finish the project.
